            <p>a deep dive into my (strange?) music taste. If you have any recommendations, please write an email. I am always open to try new stuff!</p>

			  <h3>Breakcore/DnB</h3>
			    <p>
			      This is the most recent genre I discovered. My playlist mainly consists of Sewerslvt/Cynthony and femtanyl. I just really like their style and no one does it like them.
				  My favourite songs are probably "Newlove" and "self destruction worldwide broadcast".

			  <h3>Vocaloid</h3>
			    <p>
				  I don't know when I first started listening to Vocaloid. It could be 2020 or even 2019. I think it's impressive how this genre stuck with me ever since.
			      My favourite voicebanks have to be Hatsune Miku, Teto (UTAOloid, I know) and flower (flower is underrated, trust me).
			      Among my favourite artists are Kikuo, Azari, Giga, みつあくま and IrohaRingo (the last two are lesser known but trust me, listen to ""終わカレ"はブロックで", "Love me Knive" or "Why I hate you". Those are BANGERS)
			      Anyways, this is my Vocaloid playlist with songs being added all the way back to 2021.

			  <h3>HipHop</h3>
			    <p>
				  Pretty standard genre in my opinion. Not listening to it as much as I once did, but it's sill present on some days.
				  I'm sharing this playlist with my friend and he likes the older stuff, so it has a lot of 90s and 2000s HipHop in it.
				  Good artists from this playlist are Nemzzz, Logic and Nas.

			  <h3>Nightcord at 25:00</h3>
			    <p>
				  My favourite vocal group, BY FAR. I love their voices. Mafuyu is the beeest!!! Absolute bangers are covers of "Heat Abnormal" and "Bake No Hana".
