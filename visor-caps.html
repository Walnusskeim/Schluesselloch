					<h3>Russian ushanka</h3>
					<p>I won this ushanka in a Ukrainian auction. Accordingly, it also comes from Ukraine. Let me tell you, it was a pain to get this thing into Austria. For three months, the seller and I texted back and forth because Ukraine is not part of the SWIFT payment system, so sending and receiving money is way more complicated. But now it's here, and I am happy.</p>

					<h3>United States M1 helmet</h3>
					<p>A very popular helmet, featured in many films and worn by many countries - not just the USA - in many wars. The helmet actually consists of two helmets. The outer shell is from Mangalloy and is worn during battle with the inner shell. The inner shell is made of plastic and was also worn for ceremonial purposes. My inner shell looks a bit scratched, unfortunately, but it could be worse. I'm also lucky to have a net around the helmet. That was used for better camouflage, as the outer shell used to reflect more light if it got wet. The netting could also be used to store some extra items.</p>

					<h3>Visor cap of a general of the Wehrmacht</h3>
					<p>No, I am NOT a Nazi; I am a semi-constitutional monarchist. This visor cap is a <i>replica</i>, so it's not real; please don't sue me. I bought it because, in my opinion, a visor cap from the 1935–1945 German military is mandatory in such a collection. But real ones cost too much for me :(</p>

					<h3>Chinese Police officer visor cap/USSR visor cap of an air force officer</h3>
					<p>This was a double purchase from the same seller. The Chinese one is, to this day, my most "exotic" and also the cheapest feeling of all (well, well, well). The USSR Air Force one is in beautiful condition and looks incredible. These USSR caps are always so tall, so it looks a bit goofy to wear them.</p>

					<h3>Bundesheer visor cap with the rank of Fähnrich</h3>
					<p>My next purchase had to be from the Austrian Bundesheer. So that's what I was looking for. And I found one. This one is from a Fähnrich, the lowest ranking officer. On the inside is still the surname of the owner, "Berthold".</p>

					<h3>M69 USSR army officer of infantry troops</h3>
					  <p>This is where all began. September 2023. I found this visor cap on a flea market in Innsbruck and instantly bought it. Months before this purchase, I already told myself to start a collection with these kinds of caps. And when I saw it on the market, I instantly fell in love.</p>
