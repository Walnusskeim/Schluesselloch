					<h3>DDR border guard armsleeve</h3>
					<p>
					  Once owned the matching visor cap (picture below) as well but sold it because it was kind of deformed and I could not fix it without potentionally breaking it.
					  But I decided to keep the armsleeve - which reads "Borderguards of the DDR" - because it's in beautiful condition and it doesn't take away much space.

					<h3>10.000 Mark bill (1922)</h3>
					<p>
					  The German <i>Mark</i> was the official currency of the German Empire from 1871 to 1923. However, with the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, the German Empire discontinued the gold standard. Gold coins disappeared from circulation, and the government started to print increasing amounts of unsecured paper money.
					  After the collapse of the German Empire in 1918 and the establishment of the Weimar Republic, the currency became known as the Papiermark ("paper mark"). Without any gold backing, the mark's value began to decline rapidly.
					  By 1923, the currency had become nearly worthless due to hyperinflation caused by war reparations, political instability, and economic mismanagement. There were notes circulating with a amount of 500 billion, 5 trillion, and even 50 trillion Marks.
					  Later that year, the Rentenmark ("mortgage mark") was introduced to restore economic stability.

					<h3>1 Krone (1916)</h3>
					<p>
					  The autro-hungarian krone (crown) (1892-1918) was the official currency of Austria-Hungary and replaced the Austro-Hungarian <i>Gulden</i>.
					  All banknotes were bilingual in German and Hungarian. On the upper left corner on the back of the note, other languages of the monarchy were printed as well.
					  The currency lost it's value during the First World War. Consumer prices rose sixteenfold because the government just kept on printing money to pay its bills (what were they even thinking??).
					  After the war, hyperinflation set in. Money supply increased from 12 to 30 billion Kronen in 1920, and to about 147 billion Kronen at the end of 1921. The highest banknote issued was the 500,000 Kronen note.

					<h3>Molnija (Молния) quartz pocketwatch</h3>
					<p>
					  Just a simple quartz pocket watch from the Soviet Union.
					  Unfortunately, it is not working at the moment. But when I have the opportunity to wear it, I will take it to a watchmaker to have it repaired and I will wear it.
